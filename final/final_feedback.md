# Feedback on Final

I like the basic idea of your final project. The basic analysis was good and you met most of the requirements of the final.  I would have like to see more explanation on the way and connection between teh various data sets you chose to work with.

Remember that the purpose of classes and functions is to encapsulate logic and abstract variables. I think you could have made more use of functions throughout your code.
