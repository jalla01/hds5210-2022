Overall, nicely done.  There were a couple of minor errors in the code and a few note on good programming practices I've included below.



## Step 1
* Using `i` and `j` and `temp` as variable names within your loops for objects inside a data structure like this isn't ideal. Use variable names that mean something contextually. Because this is consistent throughout your code, I'm subtracting 1 point from your _Good Practices_ score.

## Step 2
* Nice work.

## Step 3
* I like your use of `strftime('%A')` here to make your code more readable / understandable.  Most people would have to lookup if Monday as a 0 or 1 if you took the `weekday` approach.
* I appreciate the choice to include all three conditions, even though you could have simplified it down to two. I think that makes code easier to understand, trace to requirements, and test.

## Step 4
* Your part 4 didn't have a solution included. I want to confirm that was intentional. For now, I'm going to have to deduct 10 points from your _Correctness_ score because of the missing step.
